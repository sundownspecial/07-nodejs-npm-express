# Project Name

**Author**: Jesus, Greg, and Jordan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is setup to dynamically rendor data by retrieving the data from an API call.  We will take that data and push it into a template which gets rendered.  We will be using Express JS to set up a
link to our ports in the browser.  We will also utilize middleware to help us achieve what we need to in Express JS.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Install the express package as a dependency on nodeJs
2. Include all the static resources
3. Refactor some functions into arrow functions
4. Write a new route that will redirect the user from /new to /new.html
5. Do some more refactoring


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used jQuery, NodeJS, WRRC and body-parse
